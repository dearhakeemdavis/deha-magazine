-Dynamic site using PHP and MySQL (the main part of the site's code to show how I used PHP and MySQL)<br />
-My inspiration for developing this site was to gain a better understanding of working with PHP and MySQL<br />

  •	Designed a dynamic website using PHP and MySQL to load videos and their descriptions from a database<br />
  •	Created a video submission form with login<br />
  • Using Vimeo's API, the site owner can add videos from their Vimeo account by entering the video id<br />
  • The site owner can also add additional categories, videos and categories are then automatically updated to show on their live site<br />
  • Screenshots of the original site and login pages are in the 'img' folder.
