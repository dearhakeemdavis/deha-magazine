-Dynamic site using PHP and MySQL (the main part of the site's code to show how I used PHP and MySQL)<br />
-My inspiration for developing this site was to gain a better understanding of working with PHP and MySQL<br />

  •	Designed a dynamic website using PHP and MySQL to load videos and their descriptions from a database<br />
  •	Created a video submission form with login to easily add videos from Vimeo<br />
  • The form uses Vimeo's API to add videos to their chosen category once the Vimeo video id is entered<br />
  • Screenshots of the original site is in the 'img' folder.
