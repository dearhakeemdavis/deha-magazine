Redesign website for Deha Magazine
***********************************

-My inspiration for developing this site was to gain a better understanding of working with PHP and MySQL<br />

  •	Designed a dynamic website using PHP and MySQL to load videos and video descriptions from a database<br />
  •	Created a login section for the site owner to add/remove videos and categories<br />
  • Submission form uses Vimeo's API to add video embed codes to the database from the video ID entered by the user<br />
  • The main site pulls from this database, so changes are automatically reflected on the live site<br />
  • Screenshots of the original site and login pages are in the 'img' folder.
